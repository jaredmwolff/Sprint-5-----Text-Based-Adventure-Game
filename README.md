# Overview

The purpose of this code is to further my understanding of the C# Coding Language. Setting up this language was a pain, but I managed to get it working somehow.

Using C#, I crafted a simple Text-Based Adventure Game. It was simple enough so that I could familiarize myself with how the coding language worked.

Again, the purpose of this program was to further my understanding of the C# Coding Language.

# Future Work

- I had totally forgotten to make the choices revolve around LOOP statements. That's the first thing to fix.
- Adding in more routes would be pretty fun to do.
- Instead of inputting just A or B for a response, I could make it so the user can input other options as well (for example, LEFT or RIGHT)
